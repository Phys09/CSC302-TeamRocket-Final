meeting7 11/13/22

Last week:
- Finished main graph
- Finished Pie chart
- Finished getbynameandyearrange endpoint
- (good progress)

Future plans:
- Maybe no linear regression since it seems like it is just fluff (a lot of work for little return)
- Jeremiah ~ 1 hr investigation on how feasible the Linear Regression is.
- Making the UI cleaner, adding tests to make codebase more robust

Next steps (in order of priority):
- create issue for add country with new getbynameandyearrange endpoint (Jeremiah) ~ 15 min
- incorporate getbynameandyearrange endpoint to the app (Michael) ~ 1 week 
- Change submit to "add country" or something (Menghao) ~ 1 day
- Show all name options as a drop down in name field (Menghao) ~ 1 week
- Add unit tests and look into e2e test for the graph & pie chart (Jeremiah) ~ 1 week

What Linear regression would need:
- /countryname -> display graph with country name data (just that one country)
- /countyname?from={data}&to={date} -> same thing with year range
