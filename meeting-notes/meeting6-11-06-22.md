- probably use reactcharts/canvas/recharts since it has multi series graphs
- split each component feature 1 per person
- we estimate each component will take 1 week if each person works in parallel

- which tool? (we want easy integration w front end, reliability, and easy to pass data into, customizability)

- reactcharts
    - react charts has easy integration with our react front end
    - no pie charts
- recharts
    - easy integration with react
    - more popular on github
    - nice documentation
    - hover over items and shows more
    - customizable with animations and more
    - npm install
- canvas
    - also has easy to use component
    - hover over items and shows more
    - not as easy to use documentation (no react specific things)

- final choice: recharts

- web design:
    - single page (all componets on one scrollable page)
    - max countries per graph?
    - 1 graph, add button to add countries to that graph
        - name required
        - year range applies to whole graph
    - 1 pie chart to show average upon clicking country in legend
    - upon clicking legend: remove button

- in hindsight, some of our endpoints are useless (for now at least)
    - set default year range (no range to use getbyName) when no years are input
    - getByYearRange (so far useless)'

- approaches to rendering graph:
    - aggregate data in backend and send it back to graph
    - store names and use endpoint to get data in aggregated form in backend (less network calls but most of our endpoints become useless) (choose this and create extra pages to use other enpoints)

new pages:
- /name shows graph with name's data, i.e. /canada shows canada data (get by name endpoint) (Menghao) ~ 1 week
- /name?from=date1&to=date2 (get by name and year range endpoint) (Menghao) ~ 1 week

new endpoints:
- getByNamesAndYearRange (Menghao) ~ 2 days
- getAllNames (Menghao) ~ 2h


#### Next steps:
- add button + dropdown form (Michael) ~ 1 week: Top Priority
- graph (Jeremiah) ~ 1 week
- extra pages to use all endpoints (Menghao) ~ 1 week
