# Blameless Retrospctive for Assignment 2 - 11/20/22
(Copied from meeting notes for 11/20/22)
## Achieved
  - graphs to view
  - pie charts
  - autofill
  - better styling
  - multiple countries in one graph with different colors
- Most things went smoothly  

## Goals missed
- No real issues
- We had some delays but we accounted for delays in our time estimates and deadlines

## Changes for the future
- Think more critically about the design and work that needs to be done
    - issues and tasks were always being changed on the fly due to bad initial decisions
    - interupted flow in some team members who already started working on it
    - take more time, and make good concrete decisions
    - don't make quick decisions in meetings, give everyone some time to think about it.
    - read the documentation and look into the technology before you decide what needs to be done
    - Maybe because of this we should take a 1 day breather to think about the logging strategy before we make a quick decision during a meeting that sucks
    - Next time maybe we can send out meeting agendas earlier to give more time to think
