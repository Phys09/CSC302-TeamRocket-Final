# meeting8 11/20/22

## Last week
- autofill and styling
- tried testing components but couldn't figure out problem with recharts and unit test
- Looked into regression but it is unfeasible within the time constraints w the rate we are going at. Too many endpoints, research, library learning, and graph/page implmentations to do
- Tried implementing getbynameandyearrange endpoint but ended up busy with midterms but now has more time

## Next week
-  Logging implementations (Menghao) ~ 1 week
-  Logging frontend and backend + docker (Menghao) ~ 1 week
-  Investigate how to view logs, i.e. how to filter by degree/severity (Menghao) ~ 1 week
-  investigate end to end testing (ALL) ~ 1 week
-  fix unit tests (Jeremiah) ~ 3 days
-  add zoom in feature (Jeremiah) ~ 4 days
-  integrate getbynameandyearrange (Michael) ~ 1 week
 
## Logging
- flask logger easy integration with gunicorn, can log to console or file.
- works with docker (though it by default separates server/client logs)




- What to log?
    - request info (params, method etc)
    - time at each event
    - response info? (too much info, perhaps just keep it in info tag)
    - errors, exceptions
    - log at start of request in case of stalling response
- Where to log?
    - errors
    - database operations
    - successful/unsuccessful database connections
- Log files?
    - one big log file (our choice for now):
        - easier to set up
        - can get super long
        - text editors have issues with it
        - can search through all logs at once (rather than open and close diff file searching)
    - multiple files:
        - easier on the eyes
        - organized
        - maybe errors are cause by older runs and hard to tell if files are separate
    - routine to delete old logs?
- Can email errors to admins
    - too much work for our project
- data dog
    - can view realtime logs of all running instances
    - not effective for our project bc project runs local to user's machine (we don't have one server deployed for everyone)
- How to filter only INFO or DEBUG or ERROR logs
- DEBUG: for dev use only to debug code in test/dev env
    - i.e. made it to this statement, print statement stuff
- INFO: any general useful info to find/trace a bug 
    - i.e. starting this, requesting this, did this
- WARNING: something unexpected happen but app can continue running w key functionalities
    - i.e. cannot parse this string/unexpected whitespace
- ERROR: issue preventing some key functionalities, should be investigated
    - i.e. database throws error (like corrupt data)
- FATAL: fatal, cannot run

## Milestones
- We have interactive web page so we hit milestone 4

## Retro
- achieved:
    - graphs to view
    - pie charts
    - autofill
    - better styleing
    - multiple countries in one graph with different colors
- Most things went smoothly
- We had some delays but we accounted for delays in our time estimates and deadlines
- Think more critically about the design and work that needs to be done
    - issues and tasks were always being changed on the fly due to bad initial decisions
    - interupted flow in some team members who already started working on it
    - take more time, and make good concrete decisions
    - don't make quick decisions in meetings, give everyone some time to think about it.
    - read the documentation and look into the technology before you decide what needs to be done
    - Maybe because of this we should take a 1 day breather to think about the logging strategy before we make a quick decision during a meeting that sucks
    - Next time maybe we can send out meeting agendas earlier to give more time to think
