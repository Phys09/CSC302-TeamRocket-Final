Meeting 2 - 10/9/22


Server Framework:
- Django, Flask, FastApi
- Django: full framework with routing, etc
   - Lots of learning (slow down productivity)
- Flask: just basic of basic
   - Well documented
   - Older community (more stack overflow results)
   - Scalable
   - Good support for sqlite
- FastApi: like Express
   - New so less stack overflow results etc
   - Async, faster performance
   - Self generating docs using swagger api
   - Built in data validation: minimize errors
- Final choice: flask


Dataset:
- Each choose one dataset by next week and choose the best


E2E testing framework:
- Cypress, selenium, playwright, puppeteer
- Choose simplest setup since all perform same core function: test user interaction
- Selenium:
   - Old so more documentation/support
   - Multi language support
   - More set up / prerequisites
- Cypress:
   - Older than playwright
   - Parallel tests (subscription)
   - Supports CI/CD with good docs
- Playwright:
   - Newer
   - Multi language support
   - Only need node.js
   - Parallel tests
   - Supports CI/CD with good docs
   - Page for setup with github actions
   - Good docker support
- Puppeteer
   - Only chrome
- Final choice: Playwright


CI/CD:
- Github actions: (final choice)
   - Easy setup
   - One spot with our github repo (close to source code)
   - We only use linux
- Jenkins
   - Harder setup
- CircleCI
   - Any machine
Future:
- Perhaps upload docker image to hub in case of event that build fails
