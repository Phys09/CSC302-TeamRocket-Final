# Road Map

## What
We want to build an application/tool that can import a dataset, store the relevant information in a database, then dispay the data to the user. We will accomplish this in 3 milestones:  

1. Set up repository, dev environments, and initial files. Project can build, run and connect to the database. (complete)
2. Able to import data into the database on server and get data with a basic interface. (~2 weeks)
3. Able to perform transformations/calculations on the data and display it with a simple web-page. (~3 weeks)
4. Make the web-page interactive. (~2 weeks)

## How
For milestone 1, we had:
 - Jeremiah set up the initial back end and work on some documentation and road map write up.
 - Michael set up initial tests and write documentation.
 - Menghao set up initial environment and install/build/run scripts
For milestone 2, we will have:
 - Jeremiah implement CI/CD workflows/frameworks
 - Michael develop backend data processing
 - Menghao work on tests and front end design/implementation
For milestone 3, we will have:
 - Jeremiah work on data transformations + CI/CD
 - Michael develop web-page UI
 - Menghao develop tests and help develop back end
For milestone 4, we will have:
 - Jeremiah creating end to end tests
 - Michael develop interactive UI
 - Menghao develop interactive UI
 
#### Immediate next steps:
These are the immediate next actions for our second milestone since we already completed the first for Assignment 1.
Jeremiah:
 - Select the relevant dataset(s)
 - Determine architecture of database
Michael:
 - Start working on back end to allow importing data
 - Decide testing framework
Menghao:
 - Create tests relating to importing data
 - Design basic interface to display data
